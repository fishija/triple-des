# 3DES

<strong>Description</strong>

A script created to demonstrate the operation of the 3DES algorithm using the Windows console.
The script was written in Python. To verify the correctness of the program's operation,
the website https://emvlab.org/descalc/ can be used.


<strong>How it works</strong>

The application can be launched by double-clicking the attached exe file. Since the application
is console-based, a console window will open where the user can enter the text on which they want
to test the operation of the 3DES algorithm. To close the application, simply press enter (without entering any input for the algorithm).
